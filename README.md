# Clang-Format Optimizer
This project provides a tool for quickly configuring `clang-format` to match the style of an existing codebase. In other words, it aims to find a `.clang-format` configuration that minimizes the number of changes (insertions + deletions) when applied to the codebase, thereby reducing
formatting churn and improving code consistency.

## Features
*   **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Employs a genetic algorithm with an island model to explore a wide range of `clang-format` options and find an optimal configuration.
*   **Automatic Detection of `clang-format` Options**: Includes a tool to parse the latest `clang-format` documentation from the web and extracts information about available options. The result is stored in a human-readable JSON file which can be further tweaked to exclude certain options from the optimization process. Options extracted from clang-format 20 can be found in `data/clang-format-values.json`.
*   **Forced Options**: Allows users to specify certain `clang-format` options that should always be set to a particular value, overriding the optimization process for those specific options. See `data/forced.yml` as an example of the options you would typically configure by hand.
*   **Change Minimization**: The fitness function for the genetic algorithm is based on minimizing the `git diff --shortstat` output (total insertions and
deletions) after applying `clang-format`.
*   **Interactive Plotting**: Optionally visualizes the fitness evolution of the genetic algorithm using `matplotlib` (use `--plot-fitness` to enable).
*   **Graceful Termination**: Supports `Ctrl-C` to gracefully stop the optimization process and return the best configuration found so far.
## Installation
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and available in your system's PATH:
*   **Python 3.x**: The project is developed in Python.
*   **clang-format**: The `clang-format` tool itself, which is part of the LLVM project. You can usually install it via your system's package manager (e.g.,
`sudo apt install clang-format` on Ubuntu, `brew install llvm` on macOS).
*   **Git**: The version control system, used for repository operations and diffing.
### Python Dependencies
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
1.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install PyYAML requests beautifulsoup4 lxml matplotlib
    ```
    *   `PyYAML`: For parsing and generating YAML configurations.
    *   `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`: For scraping `clang-format` documentation to get option values.
    *   `matplotlib`: (Optional) For plotting the fitness history during optimization. If not installed, plotting will be disabled.
## Usage
The optimization process involves two main steps: first, generating a JSON file with `clang-format` option values (if the one provided in the repo is not sufficient/outdated), and then running the main optimizer.
### Step 1: Generate Clang-Format Option Values
The `get_option_values.py` script scrapes the official `clang-format` style options documentation to create a JSON file containing all known options, their
types, and possible enum values. This file is crucial for the optimizer to know which values to test for each option:

```sh
python3 get_option_values.py > data/clang-format-values.json
```

### Step 2: (Optional) Define Forced Options
If you have certain `clang-format` options that you always want to keep at a specific value (e.g., `ColumnLimit: 120`), you can define them in a YAML file.
Example `data/forced.yml`:

```yml
IndentWidth: 4
UseTab: Never
```

### Step 3: Run the Optimizer
The `main.py` script is the core of the optimizer. It takes your repository path and the generated option values file as input, then runs the genetic algorithm.

```sh
python3 main.py <repo_path> [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**
*   `<repo_path>`: **Required**. Path to the git repository you want to analyze and optimize the `clang-format` configuration for.
**Options:**
*   `--output <file_path>`: Path to the file where the optimized `.clang-format` configuration will be written. If not provided, the output is printed to
`stdout`.
*   `--option-values-json <file_path>`: Path to the JSON file containing `clang-format` options and their possible values (generated by `get_option_values.py`).
*   `--forced-options-yaml <file_path>`: Path to a YAML file containing options that should be forced to a specific value (e.g., `data/forced.yml`).
*   `-d`, `--debug`: Enable debug output, showing commands being executed and more verbose information.
*   `--iterations <int>`: Number of generations for the genetic algorithm (default: `100`). More iterations can lead to better results but take longer.
*   `--population-size <int>`: Total number of individuals across all islands in the genetic algorithm population (default: `4`).
*   `--islands <int>`: Number of independent populations (islands) for the genetic algorithm (default: `1`). Using more islands can help explore the search
space more effectively.
*   `--plot-fitness`: Visualize the best fitness score over time for each island using `matplotlib`.

### Example Usage
To optimize the `clang-format` configuration for a repository located at `/home/user/my_project`, using the generated JSON values and a forced options YAML,
running for 50 iterations with 4 islands, and saving the output to `optimized.clang-format`:

```sh
python3 -m src.main /home/user/my_project \
--option-values-json data/clang-format-values.json \
--forced-options-yaml data/forced.yml \
--iterations 50 \
--population-size 100 \
--islands 4 \
--output optimized.clang-format \
--plot-fitness
```
